# Hibernate-University
Created a hibernate project "University".

The application is divided into 4 accounts ("university", "administration", "faculty", "department"). 

Each account has its own responsibilities.

In an application using DAO to decouple all low-level data access operations from high-level business services.

The application interacts with the database: PostgreSQL.

The main CRUD methods for interacting with the database are create, read, update and delete.

The hibernation app was built with annotations like @Entity, @Id, @Table, etc.

Used 4 types of association mapping: one to one, one to many, many to one, many to many.

The following fetch strategies are used to read related objects from the database: EAGER and LAZY.

In a project applied JSR 303: Bean Validation which allows to express and validate application constraints.

Wrote JUnit tests for testing CRUD operations and for hibernate-validator.
